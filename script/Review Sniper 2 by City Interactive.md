The game features realistic ballistics, wind effects, bullet drop, and environmental factors that affect the accuracy of the shots. The player can also use binoculars, night vision, and thermal vision to spot enemies and objectives. The game has 10 missions that take place in different settings, such as urban areas, jungles, deserts, and snow-covered mountains. The game also has a multiplayer mode that supports up to 16 players online or on a local network.
 
Sniper 2 received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the graphics, sound effects, and sniping mechanics, but criticized the linear level design, poor AI, and lack of replay value. The game was also criticized for being too short and easy, as well as having technical issues and bugs. The game sold poorly and was considered a commercial failure. Despite this, City Interactive continued to develop more games in the Sniper series, such as Sniper: Ghost Warrior and Sniper: Ghost Warrior Contracts.
 
Sniper 2 is a game that may appeal to fans of sniping and stealth games, but it is not a game that stands out among other shooters in the genre. It is a game that has some good ideas and features, but fails to execute them well. It is a game that can be fun for a while, but not for long.

The gameplay of Sniper 2 is based on the use of a sniper rifle as the main weapon, along with a pistol and a knife for close combat. The player can zoom in and out with the scope, hold their breath to steady the aim, and use a laser rangefinder to measure the distance to the target. The game also features a bullet cam that shows the trajectory and impact of the shots in slow motion.
 
The game has two difficulty modes: easy and hard. In easy mode, the player has a red dot that indicates where the bullet will hit, and can use a save system that allows them to restart from any point in the mission. In hard mode, the player has to account for wind direction, bullet drop, and heart rate, and can only save at certain checkpoints. The game also has a realistic mode that disables the HUD and crosshair, and makes the enemies more alert and aggressive.
 
The game has a variety of missions that require different strategies and tactics. Some missions involve stealth, where the player has to avoid detection and eliminate enemies silently. Other missions involve sniping from a fixed position, where the player has to defend an area or cover an ally. Some missions also involve moving through enemy territory, where the player has to use cover and camouflage to avoid being spotted.
 
The game tries to create a realistic and immersive experience of being a sniper, but it also suffers from some flaws that affect the gameplay. The game has a linear and scripted level design, where the player has little freedom or choice in how to complete the objectives. The game also has a poor AI, where the enemies behave in predictable and unrealistic ways, such as running in straight lines or standing still in the open. The game also has some technical issues and bugs, such as glitches, crashes, and poor optimization.
